# Description of Digilab NLCR (https://digilab.nkp.cz/)

DigiLab is a recently founded platform within the National Library of the Czech Republic focused on bringing digital humanities closer to the broader academic community. This research area is fast-growing, and most scholars either lack data, datasets, or proper infrastructural support for their enquiry. Consequently, digital humanities and computational analysis miss the opportunities that already broad libraries digital repositories could offer.

## Specialisation of repository

## Supported by
